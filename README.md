# myPortfolio
This is my second homework, and also my portfolio!

I intend to post some of my recent digital illustrations to this in addition to links to my recent coding work. It's not quite professional looking, but I will modify this or maybe even start a completely new repo with more employer-friendly content as I continue to develop my coding skills throughout the course.
